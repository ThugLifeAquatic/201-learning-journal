# 301-day-05 - forms w/JQ and handlebars

No idea what is going on.  Today was kind of a shit show. Instructor was sick so we sat through our sister classes lecture.  It was not helpful, I think just because we were adapting to a new teaching style.  The lecture left our class confused and not sure what to do going forward.  Lots of confusion concerning lab-05.
