# Learning Journal: Day 10

We focused more on CSS and HTML today.  Sam showed us some new tools and techniques that will help us structure and design a web page the right way. Wireframing in codepen can be used to create pages and basic layout rapidly.  When wireframing, don't be tempted to add colors and pictures.  Colors and pictures are distracting and unprofessional. During the wireframing stage, you want your client to focus on the layout of the page only, not the content.
