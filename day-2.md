# Learning Journal: Day 2

First real day of class today. I think it went pretty well. Git is a little tedious, but I can easily see how valuable of a tool it is. I got behind during the lecture and had to play catch up.  I figured most of it out on my own though, and I think that will help me retain what I learned better. I have a good understanding of HTML and Javascript, but my CSS skills are weak. It was cool to put everything together for the first time.

- A  git add <file>
- C  git commit -m 'message'
- P  git push <destination> <branch>
