# 301-day-08 - SQL & POSTGRES

SQL -Structured Query Language

Creating a table:

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS
    users(
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,

    );
We moved pretty quickly over SQL and POSTGRES today.  I have a basic understanding of it but I'm definitely need to study and work with it a bit more before I'm comfortable with it.  

I did a little database manipulation in postgres during the lab.  I really liked the way the lab was structured.  It really helped illustrate the client-server relationship.
