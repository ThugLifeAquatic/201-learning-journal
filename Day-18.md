Bugs everywhere, but we are squashing them quickly.  I have gotten way deeper into our game code than I though I would need to. It's awesome though. The more I understand it the more I can manipulate it, and customize it. The pong paddles are much more reliable and I can even manipulate the ball speed and behavior. Pretty cool stuff.
