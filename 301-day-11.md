# 301-day-11 - Client Side Routing

Client side routing is used to organize content and behavior on a single page app without requiring ajax calls to the database. You can set the content and behavior of a "page" using a route.

Navigating to a route fires off that routes associated functions, changing the view window.

we are requiring page.js to implement our routing.
