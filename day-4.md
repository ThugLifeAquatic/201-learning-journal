# Learning Journal: Day 4

Today we did our first day of paired programming. It was an exercise in patience and communication.  My partner and I took kind of a long time to complete the assignment, but we were able to complete 2 out the 3 stretch goals.

Things learned:

- Think about what you want to say before you give directions.
- 2D arrays! Really useful for storing lots of data. Use _includes()_ to search them.
