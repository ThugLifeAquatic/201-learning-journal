# 301-Day-15 - Project Team

Today I found out who my final project team would be.  I got Brendan, Chai, and Chris.

I pitched my project idea "devEState" and my team was into it.  

devEstate, put simply, is going to be a fancy homepage for developers. Our goal is to integrate the tools and resources a junior dev needs, conveniently into a single homepage.  This way when we fire up our browser, we immediately have what we need to continue, developing, learning, and communicating with our team.

We discussed initial steps and TODOs over the weekend as well as our goals for Monday.

By the end of the day Monday, we want to have the slack api displaying messages and notifications on our prototype.

Looking forward to getting started.
