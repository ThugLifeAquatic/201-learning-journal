# 301 Day-03 - jQuery events

Yesterday, working with JQ was a friggin nightmare. I hated it. The syntax, targeting elements, figuring out what the hell "this" was referring to was a nightmare.

Today,  It's getting a little easier.  Finally moving around the DOM with a degree of confidence. Once you figure out what "this" is, its relatively easy to call the appropriate JQ functions to get things to behave how you want.  I still don't like JQ and I'm glad that after 301 it won't be a huge part of my career (fingers crossed), but at least I'm now somewhat comfortable with it. Looking forward to learning more modern libraries and frameworks and leaving JQ in the dust.
