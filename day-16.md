# Learning Journal Day 16

We planned out our proposal over slack.  My team handled user stories, wireframes, and research.  I drew up detailed diagrams and a flow chart of our problem domain, and mapped out MVP features and stretch goals.  Our plan came together really well and we were able to get started right away. The day went smoothly and we made good progress.  My team is great.
