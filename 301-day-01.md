# 301 Day-01 - Mobile First development

OMG! So much fast moving learn-learn.  Mobile first development is a whole 'nother layer to CSS shenanigans. I like it though, as much as I hate CSS.  Mobile first design simplifies the way you think about html layout.  It's intimidating at first, media queries had me pretty confused, but once I poked around a bit in skeleton and saw how it was structured, my portfolio page started coming together.  I think focusing on mobile first will result in cleaner and better organized websites overall.
