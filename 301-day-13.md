### Server stuff

To set an environment variable:

      in terminal:
      export variableName = value

  Only exists while shell session is active...but,

  You can add persistent environment variables in your shell config.

  #### NO API KEYS CLIENT-SIDE!

  Use a server side ajax request for your API key authorization via

      NPM Package:
      express-request-proxy
      put your API tokens in heroku environment

      USE: process.env

  ### Heroku Stuff

      heroku create --> returns a server URL
      heroku destroy --> destroys instance
      heroku create "custom-name" --> give your server a custom name.
      git push heroku master --> builds your application and deploys it.
      heroku open --> takes you to your live build.
      heroku run bash --> starts a bash for your heroku app.
