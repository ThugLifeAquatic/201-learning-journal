# Learning Journal Day 17

Whew! Project week is moving fast.  Our PONG game is coming together fast. Been staying up late learning how the code we used as our foundation works.  Learning a lot.  Some of the code is close to my limit of understanding, but doesn't feel out of grasp.  Every hour I spend with it the more I learn.
