# Learning Journal: Day 6

Today we had our first taste of programming with objects in JS.  We used object literal syntax, which I have very little experience with.  I'm used to using constructors in java, so literal syntax was good for me to familiarize myself with.  I think that literal syntax is good for creating objects that are unique, static, or have a one time use case, because they are not as easy to create new objects with.  Maybe they are useful for security in programming?  Time will tell.
